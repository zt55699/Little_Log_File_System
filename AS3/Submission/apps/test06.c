/* test6.c Crash simulator1
 This is a scenario 1 crash simulator.
 crashes that occur after free blocks have been allocated to a file
 For example, crash occurs during the Writing() function, after free blocks been allocated.
 
 ยง Assumption: test2,3,4,5 was sequentially performed before this test. Vdisk properly
    initialized, and few files and folders added and written.

 ยง Notice: Cannot be used to test a un-formatted disk, the vdisk to be open should be
    initialized correctly before.
