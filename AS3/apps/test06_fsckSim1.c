/* test6_fsckSim.c
 this tests the fsck function for a crushed vdisk.
 ยง Assumption: test2,3,4,5and 6CrashSim was sequentially performed before this test.
 ยง Test the Robust of LLFS, the approach of "fsck"
 ยง Handle two scenarios: crashes that occur after free
    blocks have been allocated to a file, and crashes that occur just after blocks have
    been removed from the freelist. This is the crashed scenario 1;
 
 ยง Notice: Cannot be used to test a un-formatted disk, the vdisk to be open should be
    initialized correctly before.
