/* test7_crash_sim2.c
 This is a scenario 2 crash simulator.
 crashes that occur just after blocks have been removed from the freelist
 For example, crash occurs during the Writing() function, just after blockes been removed.
 
 ยง Assumption: test2,3,4,5 was sequentially performed before this test. Vdisk properly
    initialized, and few files and folders added and written.

 ยง Notice: Cannot be used to test a un-formatted disk, the vdisk to be open should be
    initialized correctly before.
