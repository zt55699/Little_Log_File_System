/* test6.c
 ยง Assumption: test2 and test3 and test5 was performed before this test. Vdisk properly
    initialized, and few files and folders added and written.
 ยง Test the Robust of LLFS, the approach of "fsck"
 ยง Handle two scenarios: crashes that occur after free
    blocks have been allocated to a file, and crashes that occur just after blocks have
    been removed from the freelist.
 
 ยง Notice: Cannot be used to test a un-formatted disk, the vdisk to be open should be
    initialized correctly before.
